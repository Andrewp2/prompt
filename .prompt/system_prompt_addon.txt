# Project System Prompt Addon

Use this file to add project-specific guidance. It is appended after the base system prompt.

- Context: Briefly explain the project domain and any unusual conventions.
- Commands: Typical run/test commands or env you want the assistant to be aware of.
- Constraints: Any do/don't rules unique to this repo.
- Terminology: Domain terms, file extensions, or technologies to use correctly.

Example notes:
- Prefer `cargo run --bin <name>` for executables here.
- Keep shader filenames and extensions consistent (e.g., .slang, .glsl, .wgsl as appropriate).
- Large files should be summarized; avoid inlining binaries.
